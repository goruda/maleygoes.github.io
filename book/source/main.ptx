		<title>Interpreting The Derivative</title>
			 
			 
			 
			<introduction>
				
				
			<title>Why Do We Care?</title>
					<ul>
						<li>Knowing what the derivative *means* in context is how we can solve problems</li>				
					</ul>
					
					The idea is now that we know what the definition is, we can start to apply it to solve actual problems.  Once you start wrapping your head around this, and it will take some time, but you start to see why Calculus is so important.
					
			</introduction>
			
			
			<objectives><title>What will we learn?</title>
				 <ul>
					<li>Interpreting the Derivative as the slope of the tangent line</li>
					<li>Interpreting the Derivative as the IROC</li>
					<li>Interpreting the Derivative as Sensitivity</li>
				 
				 </ul>
				 
				
			 
			 </objectives>
			
			<alert> <p>HI this is an alert</p></alert>
			<note>
				<title>What Will We Need To Remember?</title>
					<ul>
						<li>That <m>f'(x)=\frac{dy}{dx}=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m> is an IROC</li>
						<li>This IROC is also the slope of the tangent line at any point</li>
						<li>Tangent means parallel slope and touching the curve just once.</li>
					</ul>
			
			</note>
		
		<p>There are 3 main ways we can view the derivative.  Geometrically (as a graphical object), Physically (as an instantaneous rate of change) and as a Sensitivity.</p>
		
		<subsection>
			<title>Physical/Applied Interpretation</title>
			
				<p>For an object in motion whose position is given by <m>y=s(t)</m> we know that the derivative <m>y'=\frac{ds}{dt}=s'(t)</m> represents the instantaneous velocity at t.</p>
				
				<p>This generalizes to all sorts of applied or physical functions (where it makes sense*).  I'll unpack this a bit more in the <strong>sensitivity</strong> section.</p>
				
				<insight><p>Units of the derivative function will be the units of the difference quotient.  <m>\frac{\text{Units of y}}{\text{Units of x or t}}</m></p></insight>
				
				<p>For example if a car is burning gas <m>G</m> gallons as a function of thousands of RPMs, <m>r,</m>then <m>G'(r) = \frac{dr}{dt}</m>represents the rate of gallons burned per thousand RPMs.</p>

		<title>Rules For Basic Function Derivatives</title>
        		
			<subsection><title>Why Do We Care?</title>
				 <p>One of the major goals, now that we know what the derivative is, is to be able to find the derivative for all the functions we know.  We start with some basic ones, using the definition, and we'll unpack them as we go.</p>
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection><title>What Will We Learn?</title>
			   <p>After we generate "rules" for each function we know, then we will be able to use them to solve problems without needing the big ugly limit definition anymore</p>
			   
				
			   
			</subsection>
		
			<subsection><title>Things To Recall</title>
				<p>We will use the limit definition of the derivative for a general function, <m>f'(x)=\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m> and algebraically work them into simpler rules.  That's the whole idea.</p>
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection><title>The Main Idea</title>
				  <p>Here's a 30ish minute lecture video walking through some of these.</p>

				<ul>
					  <li>Power Rule: <m>\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}</m></li>
					  <li>Constant Rule: <m>\frac{d}{dx} c = 0</m></li>
					  <li>Sum Rule: <m>\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) + g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx} f(x) + \frac{d}{dx} g(x)</m></li>
					  <li>Difference Rule: <m>\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) - g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx} f(x) - \frac{d}{dx} g(x)</m></li>
			  
				</ul>	
			
			
			
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection><title>Pro-Tips</title>
				<p>You will be asked to do this for a basic function on the final.  But these are not worth memorizing.  What is worth memorizing is the definition, and what it really means in its **3 interpretations** as a rate, slope, and sensitivity.</p>

		<title>Product and Quotient Rules for Derivatives</title>
        		
			<subsection><title>Why Do We Care?</title>
				 <p>As we learn to differentiate all the functions we know, we also need to understand that they come in *combinations* like sums, differences, products, quotients (and eventually, compositions, but that's a bit later).</p>
				 
				 <p>More interesting problems or situations are typically not just one function, but a combination.  So that's why this is important to understand.</p>
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection><title>What Will We Learn?</title>
			   <p>How to differentiate products and quotients of functions, i.e. <m>\frac{d}{dx}f(x)g(x)</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m>.</p>
			</subsection>
		
			<subsection><title>Things To Recall</title>
				<p>That since both f(x) and g(x) are changing, that the derivative is not just simply f'(x)g'(x), which is a very common mistake.</p>

			 <title> The Chain Rule </title>
				<p> The Chain Rule is a fundamental concept in calculus that allows us to differentiate composite functions. Composite functions are functions that are formed by nesting one function inside another. For example, consider the function <m>f(x) = \sin(x^2)</m>. This is a composite function, since the input <m>x</m> is being passed through two functions: first, the squaring function <m>x^2</m>, and then the sine function <m>\sin(x)</m>. </p>
				<p> The Chain Rule provides a method for finding the derivative of a composite function. Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be functions such that <m>y=f(g(x))</m>. Then, the Chain Rule states that the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m> is given by: </p>
				<p> <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}</m></p>
				<p> where <m>u = g(x)</m>. In other words, we first take the derivative of the outer function with respect to the inner function, <m>\frac{dy}{du}</m>, and then multiply by the derivative of the inner function with respect to <m>x</m>, <m>\frac{du}{dx}</m>. This process allows us to find the derivative of even the most complicated composite functions. </p>
				<p> Let's look at an example to see the Chain Rule in action. Suppose we have the function <m>h(x) = (2x+1)^3</m>. This is a composite function, since it can be written as <m>h(x) = f(g(x))</m>, where <m>f(x) = x^3</m> and <m>g(x) = 2x+1</m>. To find the derivative of <m>h(x)</m>, we first find the derivatives of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> separately: </p>
				<p> <m>f'(x) = 3x^2</m> </p>
				<p> <m>g'(x) = 2</m> </p>
				<p> Then, we apply the Chain Rule: </p>
				<p> <m>h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) = 3(2x+1)^2 \cdot 2</m> </p>
				<p> Thus, the derivative of <m>h(x)</m> is <m>h'(x) = 6(2x+1)^2</m>. </p>
				<p> The Chain Rule is essential -- we can differentiate complex functions that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to differentiate using basic differentiation rules. </p>

		<title> Derivatives of Inverse Functions (Ln , ArcTrig, etc.) </title>
		<p>
			If we care about functions, we care about inverses.  If you do something, you care about un-doing it.  If we analyze outputs, we will probably need to analyze inputs at some point.  Therefore, differentiating inverse functions is just something we gotta know how to do.  One of these becomes one of the most common derivatives you see in Calc 3, Diff Eq.

	<title>Derivatives of Implicit Functions</title>

	<p>We are used to having functions defined explicitly, meaning we can write them with y on one side, and all x terms on the other side.</p>

	<p>But we can very regularly run into functions that are a bit more intricate.  The circle is the easiest example of this.  There is no easy way to break <m> x^2 + y^2 = 16 </m> into a single function of <m>y=</m> some stuff involving x.  You'd need to take the square root, and this splits it into two parts -- the top and bottom.  </p>

	<p>So in our quest to differentiate all the functions we know, we need to handle this in a particular way.  What we actually use here is our knowledge of the <em>Chain Rule</em>.  Whenever we differentiate an "inner function" we know we need to multiply by the "inner derivative."  So we just take this into account, and use the derivative as an operation on the whole equation in problems like this. </p>


	<p>Everyone uses the circle, because its a good simple example, so I'll use a slightly different equation. Let's say the equation is <m> \cos(x)+\sin(y) = 3 </m>. And we want to find the derivative.  It's tough because <m> y </m> is inside the sine function.  But if we differentiated, the chain rule would actually produce a factor of <m>dy/dx</m> that we could use to solve for. </p>

	<p>So we would start with: 

		<me> \frac{d}{dx} \left( \cos(x) + \sin(y)  \right) = \frac{d}{dx} (3)</me>
		<me> -\sin(x) + \cos(y)*\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 </me>

	Here its very important that we see how the CHAIN RULE was applied on <m>\sin(y)</m> where it became <m>\cos(y)*\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.

	Then what we'd do is isolate the <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> onto one side, and everything else to the other side.  After that,  we'll have a formula for the derivative! </p>

		<me> \cos(y)*\frac{dy}{dx} = \sin(x) </me>
		<me> </me>
