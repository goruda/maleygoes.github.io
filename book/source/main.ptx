		<title>Interpreting The Derivative</title>
			 
			 
			 
			<introduction>
				The idea is now that we know what the definition is, we can start to apply it to solve actual problems.  Once you start wrapping your head around this, and it will take some time, but you start to see why Calculus is so important.
				
				<title>Why Do We Care?</title>
					<ul>
						<li>Knowing what the derivative *means* in context is how we can solve problems</li>				
					</ul>
			</introduction>
			
			
			<objectives><title>What will we learn?</title>
			
				
			 
			 </objectives>
			<remark>
				<title>What Will We Need To Remember?</title>
					<ul>
						<li>That <m>f'(x)=\frac{dy}{dx}=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m> is an IROC</li>
						<li>This IROC is also the slope of the tangent line at any point</li>
						<li>Tangent means parallel slope and touching the curve just once.</li>
					</ul>
			
			</remark>
		
		<p>There are 3 main ways we can view the derivative.  Geometrically (as a graphical object), Physically (as an instantaneous rate of change) and as a Sensitivity.</p>
		
		<subsection>
			<title>Physical/Applied Interpretation</title>
			
				<p>For an object in motion whose position is given by <m>y=s(t)</m> we know that the derivative <m>y'=\frac{ds}{dt}=s'(t)</m> represents the instantaneous velocity at t.</p>
				
				<p>This generalizes to all sorts of applied or physical functions (where it makes sense*).  I'll unpack this a bit more in the <strong>sensitivity</strong> section.</p>
				
				<remark><p>Units of the derivative function will be the units of the difference quotient.  <m>\frac{\text{Units of y}}{\text{Units of x or t}}</m></p></remark>
				
				<p>For example if a car is burning gas <m>G</m> gallons as a function of thousands of RPMs, <m>r,</m>then <m>G'(r) = \frac{dr}{dt}</m>represents the rate of gallons burned per thousand RPMs.</p>

      <section xml:id="derivative-rules">
        <title>Rules For Basic Function Derivatives</title>
        
		<p>One of the major goals, now that we know what the derivative is, is to be able to find the derivative for all the functions we know.  We start with some basic ones, using the definition, and we'll unpack them as we go.</p>
		
		<remark><p>We will use the limit definition of the derivative for a general function, <m>f'(x)=\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m> and algebraically work them into simpler rules.  That's the whole idea.</p></remark>
		
		
		<p>Here's a 30ish minute lecture video walking through some of these.</p>
		<video play-at="select" youtube="kgP7r3yvsd8"></video>
		
		<subsection>What's our aim here</subsection>
		
		<p>After we generate "rules" for each function we know, then we will be able to use them to solve problems without needing the big ugly limit definition anymore</p>
