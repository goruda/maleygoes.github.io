Kumbata 

`Posture:`
- Seated
- Vajra Posture.  
- Hands on knees.  
- Close eyes.

`Practice Notes:`
We are activating the bandhas.  
Location:
(#1) In the throat, activated by drawing in chin slightly.  
(#2) In abdomen, activated by pulling in belly button a little bit.  As if you're on a date after the pandemic.  Suck it in!
(#3) In pelvic floor, in the perineum. 


`Preparation:`
- Nine round purification breathing.
- 3 full inhales and exhales, nasally.
- Once breathing is relaxed, take a deep full inhalation through the nose, without forcing it.
- Breathing into the ribcage, not the belly.


`Main Practice`
- Breathe in, fully and deeply as comfortably without pushing out chest or belly.  Instead, breathing into the ribcage/sidebody.
*Note*: Imagine creating a vase in lower region of the abdomen, between the two lower BHANDAS.
- Hold breath (no unncecessary tension or forcing it.) with BHANDAS activated.  
- After that activated hold, slowly exhale through the nose.
*Note*: If the exhale is rapid, that means you held it too long, or forced the in-breath too much.
- Exhale fully through the nose, and there is the **Empty Hold**.  This is when the out-breath ends, and there is a natural pause before the next in-breath.
- So the next inhale would be normal, not racing for air.  (If the inbreath is forceful, you probably waited too long.)
- Practice 3x, 7x, 21x...
