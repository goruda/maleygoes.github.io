    <h4>Attendance Policy Addendum for Quarantined or Isolated Students</h4>
    <p>Students will be expected to notify instructors when they have been directed to quarantine or isolate due to a communicable disease. If a student is unable to participate in coursework due to quarantine or directed isolation, Faculty will, to the extent possible, provide the student with a reasonable opportunity to make up missed work and instruction.</p>

    <h4>Recording Class and Use of Class Recordings for Face-to-face, Hybrid and Synchronous Online classes</h4>
    <p>Participants who want to record class meetings are required to request permission from the Instructor before they may record class meetings. Participants needing to record a class meeting as part of an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, in accordance to the Recorded Lecture Agreement with Disability Services, shall notify the Instructor before the first class is recorded that this student will be recording lectures. Students who are permitted to record classes are not permitted to edit, distribute, redistribute or publicly post recordings to individuals who are or who are not students in the course without the express permission of the faculty member and of any students who are recorded. In such cases where a Professor records a class meeting and shares the recording with members of a class, students are not permitted to edit, redistribute or publicly post recordings. Students who violate this policy may be subject to the Student Code of Conduct.</p>

    <h4>Instructorâ€™s Disclaimer</h4>
    <p>The above schedule, policies, procedures, and assignments in this course are subject to change in the event of extenuating circumstances, by mutual agreement, and/or to ensure better student learning.</p>
