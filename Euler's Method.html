                                    <h2>When do we care about this?</h2>
                                    <p>This is a beginner's level idea for how we can numerically approximate solutions to IVP's.  When we can't solve ODEs by hand (most of them) we must resort to something! </p>
                                    
                                    <h2>How do we do it?</h2>
                                    <p>We start with the initial condition, \( (x_0,y_0) \) and then moving forward through the slope field given by \( y' = f(x,y) \). We take tiny steps and hope that we land on points close to the solution.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>It is a bit like trying to draw a curve with tiny straight lines, like we did when we were kids.  Because that's almost exactly what we're doing.</p>

                                    <h3>What do we need to remember?</h3>
                                    <p>You need to remember that we call the function \(y=f(x)\) a solution to the DE  \( y' = f(x,y) \) and an <strong>integral curve</strong> is the geometric stand-in for a solution.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>You should also refresh yourself on what the tangent line is if you forgot...</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <h3>Why did you say we shouldn't call it "Euler's Method"?</h3>
                                    <p>Well, everyone does.  But Euler would have hated it.  He came up with it as a pseudo-method in order to solve a larger problem.  Unto itself, he never intended it to be thought of as a legit method to solve DEs.  Because it's really not.  BUT it is a great illustrative idea.</p>
