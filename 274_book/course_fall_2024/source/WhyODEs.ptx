  <h1>Introduction to Differential Equations</h1>

  <subsection><title>Why Do I Need to Know This?</title>

  <p>Differential equations form the backbone of many scientific and engineering fields. They allow us to model and predict the behavior of dynamic systems, such as population growth, financial markets, or the motion of celestial bodies. Understanding how to work with and solve differential equations is essential for anyone pursuing a career in STEM.</p>
