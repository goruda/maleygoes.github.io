                                    <h2>Why We Care</h2>
                                    <p>Optimization is one of the biggest applications of using calc to solve problems.  We use the derivative to get that super specific analysis of change, and then use it to reduce cost and increase output!  On whatever functions act 'nicely' enough.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The key ideas here will center around the difference between finding relative (local) and global or absolute extremes.  There are times we care about either or both!</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>What we'll learn / Objectives</h2>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>How to find the maxes and mins of a function using \( f, f', f'' \)</li>
                                        <li>The difference between relative and global extremes</li>
                                        <li>When are we guaranteed to find maxes/mins?</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    <h2>What you'll need to remember</h2>
                                   <ul>
                                        <li> \( f', f'' \) give us the 'slope' and 'bend'</li>
                                        <li>\( f(x) \) is the actual height on the graph.  Will need this too!</li>
                                        
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    
                                    <h2>The actual idea</h2>
                                    
                                        <p><a href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-3-3-optimization.html"target="_blank">Reading Assignment: Active Calculus</a></p>  
                                    
                                        <img width = 400px src="https://activecalculus.org/single/external/images/3_3_Intro.svg">
                                       <p>Here we will be looking for these locations (points on the graph).  Maxes, mins - relative to their surroundings, or globally (the highest and lowest on the *entire* graph)</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Read and Work the Preview and Activity 3.3.2 in your notes.  The <strong>Extreme Value Theorem</strong> is a little mathy, but really it is quite simple.  </p>
                                    
                                        <p> The EVT means that on any closed interval [a,b] the function f(x) will have an absolute max and an absolute min.  Intuitively, this should make sense.  There should to be a highest and lowest number for a 'nice' function on a 'nice' interval, and this is what that says.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Work the rest of the activities and in-text examples as we've discussed before - 'hacking' the textbook.  At the end there are some optimization problems, but don't get too hung up on these, as we will focus on this later.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    <h2>Pro Tips</h2>
                                    <p>There are a lot of steps, and you can easily forget what you're doing, or think you're finished before you are.  Remember you are looking for points (x,y) that are highs or lows of the graph.  We use the derivative to find peaks/valleys, then compare those actual heights.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> \( f', f'' \) give us the 'slope' and 'bend'</li>
                                        <li>\( f(x) \) is the actual height on the graph.  Will need this too!</li>
                                        
                                    </ul>

                                     <p>Here there are plenty of activities in the linked reading above that work through this idea.</p>
