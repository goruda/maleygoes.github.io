      <section xml:id="sec-first-order">
        <title>First Order Equations, Definitions</title>
        
      
      <p>On this first day of class, we will go over what a DE is, why we care about them, some examples, and some preliminary definitions.As well as what you will need to review in order to be successful in this course.</p>
								
								<example><title>Why do we care about ODEs?</title>
                
                
								<p>First-order linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are a type of differential equation that have many simple yet powerful applications. Here are a few examples of applications of first-order linear ODEs:</p>
								<!-- <ol >
								<li>
								<p>Chemical reactions: First-order linear ODEs are often used to model the rate of change of the concentration of a chemical reactant as a function of time. The rate of change is typically modeled by the derivative of the concentration with respect to time.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>Radioactive decay: The rate of decay of a radioactive substance can be modeled by a first-order linear ODE. The solution to this ODE gives the amount of the substance remaining as a function of time.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>Electrical circuits: First-order linear ODEs can be used to model the voltage or current in an electric circuit as a function of time. This can be used to predict how a circuit will behave under different conditions and to design new circuits.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>Economics: Applications to economics are also used to model the behavior of consumer demand, price dynamics, market growth or decline etc. which is also based on first order linear differential equations.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>Mechanical systems: Simple mechanical systems such as a mass-spring system or a system consisting of a sliding block on an inclined plane can be modeled using first-order linear ODEs. These equations are used to predict the position, velocity, and acceleration of the object over time.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>Biological systems: First-order linear ODEs can be used to model population growth, which describes how the population of a certain species changes over time depending on the birth rate and death rate.</p>
								</li>
								</ol>
								<p>These are just a few examples of the many simple applications of first-order linear ODEs, but it's important to note that this type of differential equation can be found in many fields and can be used to model a wide range of phenomena. Our first unit will be completely centered around these equations.</p>
								
              
								<p>This class was recorded from a live class, and developed for online use. The rough structure of it is similar to math courses you have likely taken before (purposefully kept as a simple format):</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>(1) Watch the lecture <em>video </em>while taking notes and working through examples with the professor</p>
								<p>(2) Complete <em>practice problems</em></p>
								<p>(3) <em>Ask questions</em> to clarify, understand, and move on (using <em>the class Discussion Miro</em>). I expect this to be where I interact with you the <em>*majority*</em> of this class.</p>
								<p>(3.5) Additional assignments to deepen understanding (like a <em>graded HW</em> or something else)</p>
								<p>(4) Assessment of understanding (<em>Quiz/Exam</em>)</p> -->

                                    <p>One of the big differences is noticing the solutions to our problems are functions, not values.  So we are often after a family of functions that behaves in a certain way.  This is more general (and powerful) than solving a "static" equation.</p>
