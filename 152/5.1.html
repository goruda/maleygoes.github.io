	<h1> 5.1 Logarithmic Function Intro </h1>
    

		<h3>Why We Care</h3>
			<p>Logarithms we care about for mainly two reasons.  (1) is that they model things that grow quickly to start, and more slowly over the long run.  There's a lot of things in the world that act like this, and so we can build models around them.  (2) is that they are the <strong>inverse function to exponential functions</strong>.  What does this mean? It means that they will be essential in solving equations involving variables in the exponent.</p>

			<p> Logarithms are so helpful that, before the time of the calculator, engineers were able to make mega-fast calculations using only a "slide rule" which is a handheld tool that utilized logs. It was used widely by anyone working with large and small numbers, and people who were good with them could probably race you on calculating it using a TI 83 and win.  </p>
			
	
		<h3>What We'll Learn</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> The form of a log function, \( f(t) = a \log_b(t) + c\)</li>
			  <li> The properties of logs -- this is how they simplify working with big and small numbers. The most common ones:</li>
				<li>\( \log(\frac{A}{B})=\log(A)-\log(B) \)&nbsp;</li>
				<li>\( \log(A)^t = t*\log(A) \)</li>
				<li> \( \log(AB)=\log(A)+\log(B) \) </li>
				<li> \( \log(1)=0, \log(10)=1 \)</li>
            </ul>
	
		<h3>What do we need to remember to learn this?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>You will want to remember what it means to be an exponential function</li>
				<li>You will want to recall the concept of an inverse function from chapter 2</li>
			</ul>

	<h2>Reading Assignment (not optional!)</h2>
        <p><strong>Read section 5.1,</strong> working through the examples, and taking notes. <br><br><strong>HOWEVER</strong>, you should using the techniques of "Hacking Your Textbook" which I talk about in the video below.  Textbooks are useless unless used effectively!</p>

	<h3>Pro Tips</h3>
			<p> Remember that looking <strong>graphically</strong> (since algebraically we are changing stuff up) often clears up getting stuck solving problems, especially for input.
