    <h3>Why We Care</h3>
	
        <p>Exponential functions <strong>model</strong> (meaning, they can represent mathematically) so much that happens in the world.  Anything that grows or decays in proportion to the present amount: populations, drugs in the bloodstream, investments, etc.  They are WIDELY used to model situations and solve problems.</p>
	
	<h3>What We'll Learn</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Exponential Functions: Functions that have constant percent ROC</li>
		<li>Formula: \(f(t) = a(b)^t\) where \(b \ge 0 \)</li>
		<li>a = initial value, b = growth FACTOR.\(b = 1+r) where r is the growth RATE.  (What is the difference between a factor and a rate?)</li>
		<li>Growth is when b &lt 0, Decay is when \( 0 \le b\le 1 \).  As long as a &gt 0.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
	
	
	<h3>What do we need to remember in order to learn this?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>AROC formula \(\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\)</li>
		<li>Function notation y=f(t) where y is output, t is input</li>
		<li>a = initial value, b = growth FACTOR.\(b = 1+r\) where r is the growth RATE.  (What is the difference between a factor and a rate?)</li>
		<li>It may sound silly: but keeping in mind the difference between multiplying, adding, and exponents.</li>
		
		</ul>

	<h2>Reading Assignment (not optional!)</h2>
        <p><strong>Read section 4.1, working through the examples, and taking notes.  Here, all of them are worth going through.  (Some sections I will not have you read all of it). </strong><br> <br><strong>HOWEVER</strong>, you should using the techniques of "Hacking Your Textbook" which I talk about in the video below.  Textbooks are useless unless used effectively!</p>

	<h3> Worked Example 4.1 #33</h3>
	<p> I will often give a worked example in these lesson pages.  Sometimes they are from your practice set.  They do not represent the entire section!! </p>

	<h3>Pro Tips</h3>
	   <p> Note the difference between the growth FACTOR and the growth RATE.  Commonly mixes up students.  Factor means "something being multiplied"</p>
	
        <p>How to calculate AROC if you forgot:<br><center><iframe width="300" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F-7Poa3i1ZU" title="Average Rate of Change" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center> </p>

        <p>REMEMBER that the answers to odd numbered problems are in the back of the text (or for online problems, it is accessed differently) !  I expect that you are checking all of your answers.  Anything that you get really stuck on... head to the <strong>class discussion!</strong></p>
