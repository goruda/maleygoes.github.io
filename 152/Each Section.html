    <h1>What To Expect Each Session</h1>
    

    <h2>Outline</h2>
	
		<p>An outline of the key ideas provided.</p>
	
	<h2>Videos AND Readings</h2>
	
		<p>There is a very specific way I encourage you to tackle <strong>reading assignments.</strong>  Seen here: </p>
		
		<center><iframe center width="500" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gy_X3dUrix0" title="How to hack your textbook" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
		
		<p>Take good notes, organize them by section!  You will thank yourself later! </p>
		
		<p>Any questions that come up while working through problems, make sure to post to the class discussion!</p>
	
	<h2>Practice Problems</h2>
		
		<p> These can be online, and/or in the textbook.  Remember that you should be checking your own answers in the textbook! Odd answers are supplied in the back of the book.</p>
	
	<h2>Getting Stuck</h2>
	
		<p>Online classes are tough because I can't read your face to see if you're stuck. And it is a matter of time before that happens!  <br> That means you need to advocate for yourself (a great skill to get better at.)  Please use the <strong>Class Discussion</strong> to ask questions of me and your classmates.  This is where I respond the fastest, as I prioritize this part of the course over other things.</p>
	
	<h2>A Note on Time Expectations</h2>
	
		<p>On campus, a class session is about 2 hours, twice a week.  Then another 8 hours per week is expected in study and practice.  So you're looking at 12 hours per week, just for this class.  (This is by the NYS level definition of what credit hours mean by the way!)</p>
		
		<p>This can be a shock to those of us, especially working full time.  But a 12 credit hour schedule means you are dedicating 36 hours a week just to school.  So make sure to use your time wisely!!</p>
		
	<h2>Assessment (not every class)</h2>
	
		<p> Some classes there will be a graded assessment to check your understanding and learning habits.  This could be a quiz or a community problem.  See the syllabus for details on these types of assignments.</p>
