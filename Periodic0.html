                                    <h2>Why do we care about circles and angles?</h2>
                                    <p>This will be tough for you to believe.  But anything involving Signals (electrical, information) or waves (physics/engineering/life science) will relate to this. </p>
                                    <p> Why? Because anything that repeats is essentially circular.  Anything that has rythym or a pattern is circular.  And an angle is just how much we've moved around that pattern.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>What we'll learn / Objectives</h2>
                                    <ol>

                                        <li>That we move <strong>counter-clockwise</strong> when we rotate around the circle for the positive direction.  This is weird at first.</li>
                                        <li>The coordinates on any point in the plane \( (x,y) \) can be also thought of as a triangle, with one corner at (0,0) and at (x,y) (and the other on one of the axes... we just pick x-axis).</li>
                                        
                                        
                                    </ul>

                                    <div class="example"><h2>Get Your Hands Dirty / Post Lecture Problem</h2>
                                    <p>Try explaining the connection between x, y, \(\sin\theta, \cos\theta\) out loud to yourself.  (Talking to yourself is perfectly normal)</p></div>

                                <p>x is the horizontal distance from 0. y is the vertical distance from 0.  (x,y) is the rectangular coordinates.  \(\cos\theta\) is assigned to x on the unit circle.  \(\sin\theta\) is assigned to the y on the unit circle.</p>

                                    <h2>Taking It Further</h2>
                                    <p>I remember wondering why we would ever care about triangles or circles.  On their own, it seems like a waste of time.  That is completely wrong.   I had never built anything, nor cared about engineering or physics at a high level at the time.  THEY MATTER.  They come up ALOT.</p>
                                    <p>A big result later on in calculus, is that almost anything that fluctuates can really be modeled with Sine and Cosine (the x and y position going around a circle) as long as we can mess with the parameters.  Isn't that nuts?</p>
