            <title>Why do I need to know this?</title>
            <p>Exponential functions are everywhere, as they represent anything that grows in proportion to the present amount. They are also pivotal in Differential equations which are really what describe reality as we know it physically.</p>

            <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to confidently calculate the derivative of exponential functions of the form <m>f(x) = a^x</m> and <m>f(x)=e^x</m>, where <m>a</m> is a constant positive number. You will gain a deep understanding of how the derivative describes the behavior of these functions.</p>

            <title>Worked Example</title>
            <p>Find the derivative of <m>f(\theta) = e^{\tan(\theta)}</m></p>
            <p>To find the derivative of <m>f(\theta) = e^{\tan(\theta)}</m>, we will use the chain rule.</p>
            <p>Let's start by noticing the inner function, we can call it <m>u = \tan(\theta)</m>. Now, our function looks like <m>f(\theta) = e^u</m>.</p>
            <p>Next, we need to find the derivative of <m>f(\theta)</m> with respect to <m>\theta</m>. Using the chain rule, we have:</p>
            <p>
              <m>\frac{d}{d\theta} f(\theta) = \frac{d}{d\theta} e^u \cdot \frac{du}{d\theta}</m>
            </p>
            <p>The derivative of <m>e^u</m> with respect to <m>u</m> is simply <m>e^u</m>. This is why calc students do, and should, love <m>e^u</m> as a function. Now, let's find <m>\frac{du}{d\theta}</m>.</p>
            <p>Differentiating <m>\tan(\theta)</m> with respect to <m>\theta</m> gives us:</p>
            <p>
              <m>\frac{du}{d\theta} = \sec^2(\theta)</m>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, we can substitute the derivative of <m>e^u</m> and <m>\frac{du}{d\theta}</m> back into the chain rule expression:</p>
            <p>
              <m>\frac{d}{d\theta} f(\theta) = e^u \cdot \sec^2(\theta)</m>
            </p>
            <p>Since <m>u = \tan(\theta)</m>, we can rewrite the expression as:</p>
            <p>
              <m>\frac{d}{d\theta} f(\theta) = e^{\tan(\theta)} \cdot \sec^2(\theta)</m>
            </p>
            <p><em>**Sometimes you will see me make a substitution for <m>u</m> and use the chain rule. Sometimes we will skip this step. It is important to just remember the concept -- if there is an inner function, we need to remember to "respect" the chain rule.</em></p>

        <title>Related Rates</title>
    <h1>Lesson: Related Rates</h1>
    <p><h2>Why Do I Need to Know This?</h2></p>
    <p>Related rates are an invaluable application of calculus. Usually, a complex problem has not only one quantity changing, but multiple components within a system that are related somehow. This is the intention behind this unit. How do we measure change within a system of related, changing quantities?</p>
    <p><h2>What Will We Learn?</h2></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify and solve related rates problems</li>
    <li>Apply the concept of related rates to analyze changing quantities</li>
    <li>Develop problem-solving skills for real-world scenarios</li>
  </ul>
  <p><h2>What Should I Recall Before Learning?</h2></p>
  <p>Before we dive into related rates, let's recall some fundamental concepts in calculus, such as rates of change, derivatives, and the chain rule.Understanding these concepts will provide a solid foundation for tackling related rates problems.</p>
  <p><h2>The Main Idea</h2></p>
  <p><h3>Introduction to Related Rates</h3></p>
  <p>Related rates involve finding how the rates of change of two or more related variables are related to each other. We often encounter these types of problems in real-world scenarios where the rates at which quantities change depend on each other.</p>
  <p><h3>Problem-solving Approach</h3></p>
  <p>To solve related rates problems, we generally follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Identify the variables involved and establish their relationships (e.g. generate sketches, and equations)</li>
    <li>Differentiate the related equation(s) implicitly with respect to time or the independent variable.</li>
    <li>Substitute known values, and use algebra to solve for the unknown rate of change.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Head to Discourse with questions. There will be a lot of places where algebra, geometry, or problem-solving will be rusty for each of us. Make sure to start this unit early to benefit maximally from Q&amp;A.</p>

    <p>One interesting and real application of tangent line approximations in engineering is in the field of structural analysis. Engineers often use linear approximation techniques to estimate the behavior of structures under different loading conditions.</p>
    <p>For example, when designing bridges or buildings, engineers need to assess the structural integrity and stability of the components. By using tangent line approximations, they can estimate the deflection, stress, and strain on different parts of the structure. From there, they can make informed decisions about materials, dimensions, support systems, and so on.</p>

  <title>Section: Derivative of Logarithmic Functions</title>
  <subsection>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>In this section, we will explore the derivative of logarithmic functions using an applications-first approach. Logarithmic functions have numerous applications in various fields, including finance, biology, and physics. Understanding their derivatives will enable us to analyze and solve problems involving exponential growth, decay, and more.</p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Derivative of \( f(x) = \log_a(x) \)</title>
    <p>Let's start by considering the derivative of the natural logarithm function, \( f(x) = \ln(x) \), as a specific case. Later, we will discuss the derivatives of logarithmic functions with bases other than \( e \).</p>
    <p>The derivative of \( f(x) = \ln(x) \) can be found using the concept of the inverse function and the chain rule. We can write \( f(x) \) in terms of its inverse function as \( x = e^{f(x)} \).</p>
    <p>Applying the chain rule, we have:</p>
    <p>
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} x = \frac{d}{dx} e^{f(x)}</m>
      <m>1 = e^{f(x)} \cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(x)</m>
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \frac{1}{e^{f(x)}}</m>
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} \ln(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, the derivative of the natural logarithm function is 
      <m> \frac{1}{x} </m>.</p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Derivative of \( f(x) = \log_a(x) \)</title>
    <p>Now, let's generalize our result to logarithmic functions with bases other than <m> e </m>. Consider <m> f(x) = \log_a(x) </m>, where <m> a </m> is a positive constant.</p>
    <p>Similar to the natural logarithm case, we can rewrite <m> f(x) </m> in exponential form as <m> x = a^{f(x)} </m>.</p>
    <p>Applying the chain rule, we have:</p>
    <p>
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} x = \frac{d}{dx} a^{f(x)}</m>
      <m>1 = a^{f(x)} \cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(x)</m>
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \frac{1}{a^{f(x)} \cdot \ln(a)}</m>
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} \log_a(x) = \frac{1}{x \cdot \ln(a)}</m>
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, the derivative of <m> \log_a(x) </m> is <m> \frac{1}{x \cdot \ln(a)} </m>.</p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Applications</title>
    <p>The derivative of logarithmic functions has various applications in real-world problems. Let's explore a couple of examples:</p>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>1. Population Growth and Decay</title>
      <p>In population biology, the derivative of logarithmic functions helps us analyze the growth or decay rate of a population. By applying the derivative, we can determine the rate at which a population is increasing or decreasing at any given time.</p>
      <p>For example, if \( P(t) \) represents the population of a certain species at time \( t \), the derivative \( \frac{dP}{dt} \) can give us insights into the growth or decline rate of the population.</p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>2. Interest and Compound Growth</title>
      <p>In finance and investment, the derivative of logarithmic functions is used to calculate interest rates and analyze compound growth. By taking the derivative of logarithmic functions related to compound interest, we can determine the rate at which an investment grows over time.</p>
      <p>For instance, the derivative can help us find the rate of return on an investment or the interest rate required to achieve a specific growth rate.</p>
    </subsubsection>
    <p>These are just a few examples of how the derivative of logarithmic functions finds applications in different fields. By understanding the derivatives, we can gain valuable insights into exponential growth, decay, and related phenomena.</p>
