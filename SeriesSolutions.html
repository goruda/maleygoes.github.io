                                    <p>Power Series solutions, which are really just big ol' polynomials in some sense, come up as solutions to very important equations in physics, quantum mechanics, and engineering.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>What we'll learn / Objectives</h2>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>How to find the first N terms of a power series solution to a DE</li>
                                    
                                    </ol>
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    <h2>What you'll need to remember</h2>

                                    <li> How to "run a power series through" the Left hand side of a second order DE.  Basically, what we did in 7.1 was "preprocessing" this whole solution method.</li>
                                        <ul><li> Index shifting, differentiating power series, etc.</li></ul>

                                    <p>This method was essentially the main goal of this sub-unit.  RK4 is what is used in the field to get solutions to ODEs.  If they're not using RK4, they are using a variant that is based on RK4.  So you can rest in confidence that you're studying something *highly* relevant.</p>
