  <title>Geometry in <m> \mathbb{R}^3 </m> </title>

  <introduction>
  <p>
    Welcome to the world of 3D geometry! In this section, we will explore how
    to measure distances in three-dimensional space and describe spheres.
    While we’ll cover the essential formulas and definitions, our focus will
    be on understanding why these ideas matter and seeing how they come up
    in real-life situations. Let’s start by looking at a familiar scenario—
    something you might encounter every day—and then connect it to the
    underlying math.
  </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Motivation: Navigating in 3D</title>
  <p>
    Imagine you’re operating a drone that can move in any direction above
    the ground. You want to figure out how far the drone is from its takeoff
    spot, so you can plan the best path to fly back safely. Or picture a
    submarine exploring the ocean depths: it might need to maintain a
    certain distance from the seafloor. These situations both revolve
    around figuring out the distance between two points in
    three-dimensional space.
  </p>
  </subsection>

    <title>The Distance Formula in 3D</title>>

  <subsection>

    <title> Coordinates of Points in 3D</title>
  <p>
    When we work in three dimensions, we label each point with three
    coordinates <m>(x, y, z)</m>. Think of <m>x</m> as the left–right
    direction, <m>y</m> as the forward–back direction, and <m>z</m> as
    the up–down direction.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A point <m>P</m> is located at <m>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>)</m>.</li>
    <li>Another point <m>Q</m> is located at <m>(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>)</m>.</li>
  </ul>
  </subsection>

  

  <subsection>
    <title>The Distance Formula</title>
  <p>
    If you need the distance <m>d</m> between <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, you
    can use a direct extension of the Pythagorean theorem from two
    dimensions to three dimensions. The formula is:
  </p>
  <me>
    d = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² + (z₂ - z₁)²).
  </me>
  <p>
    This expression captures the combined difference in each of the three
    directions.
  </p>
  </subsection>
  <p><strong>Example (Drone Navigation):</strong></p>
  <p>
    If your drone starts at <m>(2, -1, 5)</m> and ends up at
    <m>(5, 3, 7)</m>, the distance traveled is
  </p>
  <me>
    \sqrt{(5 - 2)² + (3 - (-1))² + (7 - 5)²}
    =\sqrt{3² + 4² + 2²}
    = \sqrt{9 + 16 + 4}
    = \sqrt{29}.
  </me>
  <p>
    So the drone is <m>\sqrt{29}</m> units away from its starting point.
  </p>
 </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Equations of Spheres</title>
  <p>
    A <strong>sphere</strong> in three-dimensional space is the set of
    points that are all at the same distance, called the
    <strong>radius</strong>, from a fixed point called the
    <strong>center</strong>. Spheres are often used in physics (like
    modeling planets or atoms), in computer graphics (3D animations), and
    even in global positioning systems (GPS relies on distances from
    satellite “spheres”).
  </p>
  </subsection>
 
  
  <subsection>
  <title>3.1 Standard Form of a Sphere</title>
  <p>
    If a sphere has a center at <m>(h, k, l)</m> and a radius <m>r</m>,
    any point <m>(x, y, z)</m> on the sphere satisfies:
  </p>
  <me>
    (x - h)² + (y - k)² + (z - l)² = r².
  </me>
  <p>
    This is basically the 3D distance formula set equal to a constant
    radius <m>r</m>.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Example (GPS Satellites):</strong></p>
  <p>
    GPS satellites broadcast their positions and send signals that travel
    at the speed of light. The distance between a satellite and your
    receiver on Earth is like the radius of a sphere. Your receiver
    calculates its position by finding the intersection of several of
    these “distance spheres” from different satellites. Wherever they
    intersect is where you are located on the planet’s surface.
  </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection><title>3.2 Visualizing a Sphere</title>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Center:</strong> <m>(h, k, l)</m></li>
    <li><strong>Radius:</strong> <m>r</m></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you wanted to picture it in your mind, think of wrapping a
    basketball around a point in space. The surface of the sphere is the
    collection of all points that are exactly <m>r</m> units from the
    center.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Working Through a Practice Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s put these ideas into practice with a quick exercise.
  </p>

  </subsection>

  <p><strong>Practice Problem:</strong></p>
  <p>
    A certain GPS satellite orbits at a center point <m>(20000, 0, 0)</m>
    in kilometers (this is not an actual orbit location—just an example).
    The sphere representing all the points it can reach on Earth at a
    given instant has a radius of 2000 km. Write an equation for this
    sphere.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>The center of the sphere: <m>(h, k, l) = (20000, 0, 0)</m>.</li>
    <li>The radius of the sphere: <m>r = 2000</m>.</li>
    <li>
      Plug into the formula:
      <me>
        (x - 20000)² + (y - 0)² + (z - 0)² = 2000².
      </me>
      Or more simply:
      <me>
        (x - 20000)² + y² + z² = 4,000,000.
      </me>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    That’s it! You’ve written the equation of the sphere.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>

      points <m>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>)</m> and
      <m>(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>)</m>, remember
      <me>
        d = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² + (z₂ - z₁)²).

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Equation of a Sphere</strong> – A sphere with center
      <m>(h, k, l)</m> and radius <m>r</m> is given by
      <me>
        (x - h)² + (y - k)² + (z - l)² = r².
      </me>
    </li>

    <strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> You’ll use distance formulas and the
    concept of spheres to tackle more advanced topics like level surfaces,
    gradients, and optimization in 3D. By appreciating the real-world
    motivations—like finding paths for vehicles, mapping planetary orbits,
    and designing engineering solutions—these mathematical tools become
    more intuitive and more powerful.

    Keep practicing, and remember to look for ways these ideas show up in
    everyday life. You’ll soon see that the world around us is brimming
    with three-dimensional geometry in action!
