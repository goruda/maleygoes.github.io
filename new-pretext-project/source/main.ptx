        <title>Multivariable limits</title>
        <p>In calculus 1, we learn about limits of functions of a single variable. For example, we might be interested in finding the limit of a function <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches some value <m>a</m>, denoted by</p>

			<p><m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m></p>
			<p>This limit tells us what value <m>f(x)</m> approaches as <m>x</m> gets arbitrarily close to <m>a</m>.</p>

			<p>In calculus 3, we extend this idea to functions of multiple variables. For example, we might be interested in finding the limit of a function <m>f(x, y)</m> as <m>(x, y)</m> approaches some point <m>(a, b)</m>, denoted by:</p>

			<p><m>\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f(x,y)</m></p>
			<p>This limit tells us what value <m>f(x,y)</m> approaches as the point <m>(x,y)</m> gets arbitrarily close to the point <m>(a,b)</m>.</p>

			<p>However, there's a catch: unlike in calculus 1, where we only had to worry about approaching a point from one direction (either the left or the right), in calculus 3 we have to consider all possible directions from which the point can be approached.</p>

			<p>To see why this is important, consider the function <m>f(x, y) = \frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2}</m>. If we try to evaluate the limit of <m>f(x,y)</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches the origin, we might naively think that the limit is 0, since the numerator approaches 0 faster than the denominator as <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> both approach 0.</p>

			<p>However, if we approach the origin along the path <m>y = mx</m>, where <m>m</m> is some constant, we get:</p>

			<p><m>f(x, mx) = \frac{mx^2}{x^2 + m^2 x^2} = \frac{m}{1+m^2}</m></p>
			<p>which does not approach 0 as <m>x</m> approaches 0 if <m>m</m> is nonzero.</p>

			<p>This means that the limit of <m>f(x,y)</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches the origin does not exist, even though it might seem like it should. In calculus 3, we need to consider all possible directions of approach to determine whether or not a limit exists.</p>
