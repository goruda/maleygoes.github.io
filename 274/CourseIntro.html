									<h3>Goals</h3>
									<p>My goals for this class are mainly two:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>To introduce (and classify) differential equations and methods to solve them, noting the challenges and unique issues that arise from them, along with pointing to interesting applications when possible.</li>
											<li> <strong>Fluency</strong> in reading differential equations and calculus.  I want you to be able to read an engineering/physics/mathematical white paper, and be able to have a basic understanding of what it means.. </li>
										</ol>
									
									<p>I hope that my goals and philosophy underneath this course resonates with you.</p>
									
									<h3>Topics</h3>
									<p>I am actually not going to go into this here, as I lay this out in the first lecture.  We will study what differential equations are, and how to solve them, and when we can't.  Ha.</p>
									
									<h3>Structure and Expectations.</h3>
									<p>Here is something that people need to know up front, especially in online classes.  The class has short(ish) lectures which are really my attempt to give an introduction, and brief examples to demonstrate techniques or basic approaches.  Each equation can have wildly different things going on, so I cannot do an example of 'every type of problem'.  This is very much a class in <strong>learning by doing.</strong>  To that end, I emphasize the practice problems very much.  These take time, and thought.  And conversation.  If you have been able to quickly move through math problems in your past, this is usually the class where that stops for most people.  <strong>Set yourself up for success</strong>, and <strong>do not rush</strong> this.</p>
									
									<p>Grading assignments is something that I do in batches.  I am not the fastest, because philosophically I put more emphasis on real-time/fast-response to questions about the material.  I intentionally give all of the answers to practice problems, so that you will be aware immediately if you are on the right track or not.  So the class is set up in order to allow you and me time to work through your inevitable questions (but this requires staying on top of the schedule).</p>
									
									<p>If you're getting stuck, this is when you reach out to me, via the Class Discussion Miro, or email, or office hours.  Obviously this is not effective if it is after a test, or the night before a big deadline, etc.  Stay on top of the pacing guide, and you will do well.  It is not that I like to move through this class quickly, quite the opposite -- but our syllabus is somewhat of a contract and we need to get through it in order to certify your knowledge and prep you for the next phase of your academic or working life.</p>
									
									<p>I am very flexible, but only as far as it stays within my philosophy of the course.  </p>
									
									<h4>Strategy Guide: What to do, When, Why</h4>
									<ol>
									<li>Stay on pace</li>
									<li>Watch next Lecture Video, taking notes (2x a week)</li>
									<li>Post Lecture Problems (if any)</li>
									<li>Textbook Practice Problems started immediately after video.  Working on these 5-6 days a week.</li>
									<li><strong>Class Discussion Miro</strong> when you get stuck (big whiteboard classroom)</li>
									<li>Graded HW's -- Pushing Further.  About  week for each of these.</li>
									<li>Exams (~3-4 weeks)</li>
									
									</ol>
									
									
									
									<h4>Pro-Tips and Please-Don't's (I'm a big lists guy, apparently)</h4>
									<ol>
										<li>Print off and stay on top of the schedule.  Treat this like a class that meets in person 2x a week.</li>
										<li>Remember that I emphasize answering questions &gt; all.  If you want feedback or are stuck, reach out.  I am pretty darn quick.</li>
										<li>Make yourself quality, deep-thinking time, where you'll be undisturbed.  For me, that's early morning.  You need to find that time for yourself.  Anything else, won't work well.</li>
										<li>DON'T think you can take several days off, just because due dates look like they're later on.  You don't need to spend hours every day, but you should be working most days of the week on this class.</li>
										<li>DON'T "do what's due".  Do things in order, in the way I designed the class.  You are much more likely to be successful.</li>
									</ol>
									
									
									<h3>Navigation</h3>
									<p>"How do I know if I've done everything I need to?"</p>
									<p>I get that question a lot, and I get it.  We're used to zipping around the internet.  We need to take online classes slow, and thorough.  Everything is broken down by "Session".  If you have turned over everything in each session, you've done what I asked you to do.  You can rest easy once that is the case!</p>
									<p>Give yourself the time to find everything in the course before proceeding.</p>
