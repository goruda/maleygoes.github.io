								<p>On this first day of class, we will go over what a DE is, why we care about them, some examples, and some preliminary definitions.&nbsp; As well as what you will need to review in order to be successful in this course.</p>

								<h2>Why do we care about ODEs?</h2>
								<p>First-order linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are a type of differential equation that have many simple yet powerful applications. Here are a few examples of applications of first-order linear ODEs:</p>
								<ol >
								<li>
								<p>Chemical reactions: First-order linear ODEs are often used to model the rate of change of the concentration of a chemical reactant as a function of time. The rate of change is typically modeled by the derivative of the concentration with respect to time.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>Radioactive decay: The rate of decay of a radioactive substance can be modeled by a first-order linear ODE. The solution to this ODE gives the amount of the substance remaining as a function of time.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>Electrical circuits: First-order linear ODEs can be used to model the voltage or current in an electric circuit as a function of time. This can be used to predict how a circuit will behave under different conditions and to design new circuits.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>Economics: Applications to economics are also used to model the behavior of consumer demand, price dynamics, market growth or decline etc. which is also based on first order linear differential equations.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>Mechanical systems: Simple mechanical systems such as a mass-spring system or a system consisting of a sliding block on an inclined plane can be modeled using first-order linear ODEs. These equations are used to predict the position, velocity, and acceleration of the object over time.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>Biological systems: First-order linear ODEs can be used to model population growth, which describes how the population of a certain species changes over time depending on the birth rate and death rate.</p>
								</li>
								</ol>
								<p>These are just a few examples of the many simple applications of first-order linear ODEs, but it's important to note that this type of differential equation can be found in many fields and can be used to model a wide range of phenomena.&nbsp; Our first unit will be completely centered around these equations.</p>
								<h2><strong>About this class</strong></h2>
								<p>This class was recorded from a live class, and developed for online use.&nbsp; The rough structure of it is similar to math courses you have likely taken before (purposefully kept as a simple format):</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>(1) Watch the lecture <strong>video </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">while taking notes</span> and working through examples with the professor</p>
								<p>(2) Complete <strong>practice problems</strong></p>
								<p>(3) <strong>Ask questions</strong> to clarify, understand, and move on (using <strong>the class Discussion Miro).&nbsp; </strong>I expect this to be where I interact with you the <strong>*majority*</strong> of this class.</p>
								<p>(3.5) Additional assignments to deepen understanding (like a <strong>graded HW</strong> or something else)</p>
								<p>(4) Assessment of understanding (<strong>Quiz/Exam</strong>)</p>

                                    <p>One of the big differences is noticing the solutions to our problems are functions, not values.  So we are often after a family of functions that behaves in a certain way.  This is more general (and powerful) than solving a "static" equation.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <h2>Get Your Hands Dirty</h2>
                                    <p> 
									<ol>
										<li>Is the function \(y = 2e^{-x}\) a solution to the differential equation \(dy/dx + 2y = 0\)?<br>Answer: Yes</li>
										<li>Verify that \(y = x^2\) is a solution to the differential equation \(y' = 2x\).<br>Answer: Yes</li>
										<li>Check if \(y = \cos(x)\) is a solution to the differential equation \(y'' + y = 0\)<br>Ans: Yes</li>
										<li>Can you verify if \( y = xe^x \) is a solution to the differential equation \(y' + xy = x^2\) ?<br>Ans: No.</li>
