%6.2 Notes

Matrix-vector formulation is a method to represent systems of linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in a compact form. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with multiple interrelated differential equations.

### Matrix-Vector Formulation

Consider a system of linear differential equations. This system can be expressed in the form:

\[
\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + b(t)
\]

Here, \(\dot{x}(t)\) represents the derivative of the vector \(x(t)\) with respect to time, \(A\) is a matrix of coefficients, \(x(t)\) is a vector of variables, and \(b(t)\) is a vector of functions.

### Example

Suppose we have a system of two linear differential equations:

1. \(\dot{x}_1 = 3x_1 + 2x_2 + e^t\)
2. \(\dot{x}_2 = -x_1 + 4x_2 + \sin(t)\)

To write this system in matrix-vector form, we first identify the vector \(x(t)\) and the matrix \(A\):

- \(x(t) = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix}\)
- \(A = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 \\ -1 & 4 \end{pmatrix}\)
- \(b(t) = \begin{pmatrix} e^t \\ \sin(t) \end{pmatrix}\)

Now, we can write the system as:

\[
\dot{x}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 \\ -1 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} e^t \\ \sin(t) \end{pmatrix}
\]

We use this compact matrix-vector form since (as we've seen in the last lesson) it is easier to analyze and solve, especially with computational tools.

## Solving Homogeneous Systems of Linear Constant Coefficient ODEs

In a homogeneous system of linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the system can be represented in the form:

\[
\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t)
\]

where \(\dot{x}(t)\) is the derivative of \(x(t)\) with respect to time, \(A\) is a constant matrix, and \(x(t)\) is the vector of unknown functions. To solve this system, we use eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix \(A\).

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Solving homogeneous systems of linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equations (ODEs) often involves using an ansatz, or a proposed solution form. The ansatz for such systems is typically \( x(t) = e^{\lambda t} \mathbf{v} \), where \( \lambda \) is a scalar and \( \mathbf{v} \) is a vector. This approach is effective due to the properties of exponential functions and their derivatives.

The key idea is to substitute \( x(t) = e^{\lambda t} \mathbf{v} \) into the differential equation and exploit the fact that the derivative of an exponential function is proportional to the function itself. This substitution often simplifies the problem into an eigenvalue problem, where finding \( \lambda \) and \( \mathbf{v} \) that satisfy the system becomes the goal.

### Example

Consider the system of linear ODEs given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= 3x + 4y \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= -4x + 3y
\end{aligned}
\]

We use the ansatz \( \mathbf{x}(t) = e^{\lambda t} \mathbf{v} \), where \( \mathbf{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\ y(t) \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} \).

Substituting \( \mathbf{x}(t) \) into the system, we get:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\lambda e^{\lambda t} v_1 &= 3e^{\lambda t} v_1 + 4e^{\lambda t} v_2 \\
\lambda e^{\lambda t} v_2 &= -4e^{\lambda t} v_1 + 3e^{\lambda t} v_2
\end{aligned}
\]

Simplifying, we can cancel \( e^{\lambda t} \) from both sides:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\lambda v_1 &= 3v_1 + 4v_2 \\
\lambda v_2 &= -4v_1 + 3v_2
\end{aligned}
\]

This leads to the matrix equation \( (A - \lambda I) \mathbf{v} = 0 \), where \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 4 \\ -4 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( I \) is the identity matrix. The values of \( \lambda \) that satisfy this equation are the eigenvalues, and the corresponding vectors \( \mathbf{v} \) are the eigenvectors. By solving this eigenvalue problem, we find the solutions to the original ODE system.

#### Steps to Solve the System:

1. **Find Eigenvalues**: Solve \(\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0\) to find the eigenvalues \(\lambda\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix of the same size as \(A\).

2. **Find Eigenvectors**: For each eigenvalue \(\lambda\), solve \((A - \lambda I)v = 0\) to find the corresponding eigenvector \(v\).

3. **Form the General Solution**: If \(\lambda_i\) is an eigenvalue with corresponding eigenvector \(v_i\), then \(e^{\lambda_i t}v_i\) is a solution to the system. The general solution is a linear combination of these solutions for all eigenvalues.

#### Example:

Consider the system:

\[
\dot{x}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ -2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} x(t)
\]

**Step 1: Find Eigenvalues**

\[
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = \text{det}\left(\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 1 \\ -2 & 1 - \lambda \end{pmatrix}\right) = (4 - \lambda)(1 - \lambda) + 2 = \lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 6
\]

Solving \(\lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 6 = 0\) gives \(\lambda_1 = 2\), \(\lambda_2 = 3\).

**Step 2: Find Eigenvectors**

For \(\lambda_1 = 2\):

\[
(A - 2I)v = 0 \implies \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ -2 & -1 \end{pmatrix}v = 0
\]

Solving this gives \(v_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\).

For \(\lambda_2 = 3\):

\[
(A - 3I)v = 0 \implies \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ -2 & -2 \end{pmatrix}v = 0
\]

Solving this gives \(v_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

**Step 3: Form the General Solution**

The general solution is:

\[
x(t) = c_1 e^{2t}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} + c_2 e^{3t}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants determined by initial conditions.

## Example: Solving a System of Linear Constant Coefficient ODEs

Consider the system of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs):

\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx_1}{dt} &= -\frac{x_1}{120} + \frac{x_2}{100}, \\
\frac{dx_2}{dt} &= \frac{x_1}{120} - \frac{x_2}{50}.
\end{align*}
\]

with initial conditions \( x_1(0) = 1 \) and \( x_2(0) = 7 \).

### Step 1: Rewrite in Matrix Form

First, we rewrite the system in matrix form:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{120} & \frac{1}{100} \\ \frac{1}{120} & -\frac{1}{50} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Let \( A = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{120} & \frac{1}{100} \\ \frac{1}{120} & -\frac{1}{50} \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 2: Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of A

To solve this system, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix \( A \). The eigenvalues \( \lambda \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix.

\[
\det\left( \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{120} - \lambda & \frac{1}{100} \\ \frac{1}{120} & -\frac{1}{50} - \lambda \end{bmatrix} \right) = 0.
\]

Solving this equation will give the eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 \). For each eigenvalue, find the corresponding eigenvector by solving \( (A - \lambda_i I) \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} \).

### Step 3: General Solution

The general solution of the system is a linear combination of the eigenvectors, multiplied by exponential functions of the eigenvalues:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} x_1(t) \\ x_2(t) \end{bmatrix} = c_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 e^{\lambda_2 t} \mathbf{v}_2,
\]

where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants determined by the initial conditions.

### Step 4: Apply Initial Conditions

Use the initial conditions \( x_1(0) = 1 \) and \( x_2(0) = 7 \) to solve for \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \). Substitute \( t = 0 \) into the general solution and set it equal to the initial condition vector:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} = c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2.
\]

Solve this system of equations to find the values of \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \).

### Step 5: Final Solution

Substitute \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) back into the general solution to get the final solution:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} x_1(t) \\ x_2(t) \end{bmatrix} = (c_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} \mathbf{v}_1) + (c_2 e^{\lambda_2 t} \mathbf{v}_2).
\]

This final expression gives the solution to the original system of ODEs.
