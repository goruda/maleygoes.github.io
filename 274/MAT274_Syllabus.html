<h2 id="course-design">Course Design</h2>
<p>This is a lecture-based course. However, the lectures are
pre-recorded and assigned as “homework" and class time will be devoted
to solving problems and applying methods from lectures.<br />
The course design might be very different, or the format might sound
familiar to you. However it is my goal to make the lecture videos
engaging, illustrative, and brief at the same time. Many students
greatly enjoyed this format, especially for higher level math, since
they can rewind and slow the lectures down, which we cannot do in the
classroom.<br />

<p><strong>Note on availability: I usually log on in
the mornings to grade, create videos and then teach my live classes. I
reply to posts and emails in the late morning around 10 or 11. At most
you should expect 24 hours to hear back from me, usually much shorter,
but rarely it might be 48 hours. I try to take one day away from screens
on the weekend.<br />

<p>You are most certainly invited to make appointments outside of this
time. When requesting, please send 2-3 times that you know would work
for you to expedite the scheduling process.<br />
Office hours are drop in during the regular Spring and Fall semesters,
but ahead notice or appointments are appreciated. Please come with
assigned readings completed and assigned problems attempted so that our
time spent can be targeted and effective. If I am working with someone
already I may ask you to return at a later time.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="catalog-description">Catalog Description</h2>
<p>This course is an introductory survey of ordinary differential
equations. First order differential equations and methods for obtaining
solutions are investigated. Methods include integration, variation of
parameters, and integrating factors. These methods are generalized for
second order differential equations. Additional methods include
numerical approximation, Laplace Transforms, and power series.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisitesco-requisites">Prerequisites/Co-requisites</h2>
<p>MAT 272 with a C- or better</p>
<h2 id="course-learning-outcomes">Course Learning Outcomes</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Use the language and notation of ordinary differential
equations.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize and/or classify various types of ordinary differential
equations.</p></li>
<li><p>Observe an application situation and apply the appropriate
differential model.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the concepts behind various transformations used in
differential equations.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpret graphically the behavior of solutions to differential
equations.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate results for reasonableness.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Students may vary in their competency levels on these outcomes, and
they can expect to achieve these outcomes only if they honor all course
policies, attend class regularly, complete all assigned work in good
faith and on time, and meet all other course expectations of them as
students.</p>
<h2 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h2>
<p>You will need a working computer with internet access. You will also
need a <strong>backup plan</strong> in case your internet goes down, or
your computer malfunctions.<br />
The Textbook we are using is <em>Elementary Differential Equations</em>
by William F Trench. It is a free digital PDF and included in the online
course hub. If you would like to print it off, you are on your own for
the printing costs.<br />
The textbook is used for supplemental readings and homework sets.<br />
You will need a Ti-84 or equivalent graphing calculator. If you are
familiar with Desmos, you will be able to use this on the computer
instead of a handheld device.</p>

<p>This is how active you are in the course. This involves staying

<li><p>Attending class sessions</p></li>
<li><p>Pre-class &amp; in-class Quizzes</p></li>
<li><p>Post Lecture Problems</p></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>
<p>Exams are meant to assess your understanding. Any use of additional
software, websites, people, etc. in attempt to solve problems is
considered plagiarism and will be dealt with accordingly. Please see
section on Plagiarism in math courses.<br />
There are 4 exams covering the 4 thematic units of the class. There is
no cumulative final exam in this course.</p>
<h2 id="plagiarism-in-math-courses">Plagiarism in Math Courses:</h2>
<p>There have been a large number of apps, websites, etc. developed in
the last 10 or so years to “help” students with their math assignments.
Some, at times, are actually helpful. However it is clear that on more
procedural problems, they are serving students as an answer generator.
Your practice problems are meant to help you understand the concepts,
which prepares you for your future courses and assessments (exams). If
you lean on tools that aren’t available during assessments you are
hamstring-ing yourself to do poorly. You can’t really Google translate
yourself through a Spanish course - so I don’t recommend trying that
here.<br />
Simply: don’t use these tools unless you are checking your work. If you
think you cannot resist the temptation, just refuse using them
altogether. Can’t stress that enough. It is often clear as day when they
have been used - which means the plagiarism policy will be enforced. See
below for Academic Integrity policy.</p>

<h1 id="instructor-policies-class-expectations">Instructor Policies
&amp; Class Expectations</h1>
<h2 id="attendance-and-tardiness">Attendance and Tardiness</h2>
<p>You are expected to attend all scheduled classes, and be on time. In
addition, you are responsible for material covered, practice
assignments, and announcements made during class whether present or not.
I expect you to be prepared for class even if you missed the previous
class or could not log on for a certain amount of time. Get in touch
with me and/or your classmates if you need to miss a class.<br />
For online students, this means regularly logging in and working on
assignments multiple times a week. If this does not happen, you will
fall behind, and you can understand why I won’t be lenient with
you.<br />
This is the number one piece of advice given between college students –
don’t pay for a class you’re not attending!<br />
</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity-honesty-policy">Academic Integrity / Honesty
Policy</h2>
<p>Any case of plagiarism, submitted computer-generated/aided or another
individual’s work, or copying will be dealt with in the following
manner:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1st offense: All parties involved will receive a 0 for the
assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>2nd offense: Automatic failure for the course.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="classroom-behavior">Classroom Behavior</h2>
<p>Any behavior or activity that detracts from a positive learning
environment is not acceptable.</p>
<h2 id="expectations-for-students">Expectations for Students</h2>
<p>In addition to the obvious–reading chapters before completing
practice problems, completing assignments thoroughly and on time, and
contributing to class discussions–it is also expected that you will
treat classmates with respect, avoiding gratuitous arguments, and
observing the rules of confidentiality regarding personal information
shared in class.<br />
As said above, you are responsible for what was covered each class,
which is made much easier if you are present.<br />
Watching all video lectures (actively) and completing all assigned
problems (with curiosity + perserverance) are what are expected if you
wish to learn the material effectively and do well on exams.</p>
<h2 id="expectations-for-instructor">Expectations for Instructor</h2>
<p>I will follow the course outline as closely as possible and will
notify you of modifications in the outline if they happen. I will
attempt to create and maintain a classroom atmosphere in which you feel
free to both listen to others and express your views and ask questions
to increase your learning. Please make an appointment to see me if there
is anything you want to discuss or about which you are unclear. I want
to be supportive of your learning and growth.<br />
It is my commitment to excellence, and to honor your time and efforts,
to make each class worth attending. If that is not the case, please let
me know how I can improve.</p>
